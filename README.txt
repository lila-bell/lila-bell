Hi there!

My repositories are updated to show my emerging data science and geospatial analytics skills

I'm incredibly passionate about anything Maritime-related, Humanitarian-related, and Systems Theory (the list could really go on and on)

Iâ€™m ready for a new career step - don't hesitate to get in touch with me if you have a job opportunity or are looking to collaborate on a project!

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my background in global politics and ethnic studies and how I plan to combine it with data analytics

Fun Fact:

I am an avid sailor and am also passionate about hiking and painting landscapes
