										<h3>Objective</h3>
										<p>Detect patterns of statistically significantly high SNAP participation within the United States and determine how these participation rates have changed over time.</p>
									</header>
								<header>
										<h3>Challenge</h3>
										<p>To incorporate the spatial and temporal aspects of the data to help understand its spatiotemporal trends. To create and become familiar with the space-time cube to use with the Emerging Hot Spot Analysis and Local Outlier Analysis tools.</p>
									</header>
								The Space-Time Pattern Mining 2D map illustrates 2019 SNAP participation rates for counties in the contiguous United States. The color scheme uses the Mann-Kendall statistic to identify areas that have increased rates (purple) or decreased rates (green) of SNAP participation over time.<br />
								Tools including a hot spot analysis and an outlier analysis were used to identify areas with statistically significantly high SNAP participation in the contiguous United States during 2019. This information can help in the allocation of SNAP resources to areas of higher food insecurities and can help drive decisions to distribute resources in a more efficient and equitable way.<br/ >
								Underneath the map, the scatterplot shows statistically significant clusters of high and low values as well as outliers that have values that are statistically different from their neighbors in space and time.

											<ul>
												Detecting Patterns:
												<li>Ran a hot spot analysis to analyze patterns of high and low values of SNAPrate (a percentage of eligible people who participate in the SNAP program in each county). The result is a layer displaying hot spots in three shades of red and cold spots in three shades of blue. The varying shades correspond to three confidence intervals, indicating how confident one can be that these patterns are not the result of random chance.</li>
												<li>Reviewed the analysis details to ensure that the parameters were appropriate for the analysis of SNAP participation. After careful review, the default distance band was reduced from 150 kilometers to 75 kilometers to detect more local patterns in this county-level dataset</li>
												<li>Interpreted the data and found that generally, the southeastern areas of the contiguous United States have statistically significantly high SNAP participation, and the north-central areas of the contiguous United States have statistically significantly low SNAP participation</li>
												<li>Ran an outlier analysis tool</li>
												
												Exploring data patterns using space-time mining tools:
												<li>Analyzed fixed locations (counties) with an attribute (SNAP rates) that changes over time by creating a space-time cube with input from defined locations</li>
												<li>Visualized the results of the space-time cube in 2D. The result shows varying shades of purple and green to indicate how confident that one can be that these increased and decreased trends are not random and represent meaningful patterns</li>
												<li>Visualized the results of the space-time cube in an interactive 3D environment using scenes</li>
												<li>Ran an emerging hot spot analysis to analyze a feature's spatial and temporal neighbors. This analysis helped determine whether the feature and its neighborhood are statistically significantly different from the study area. It helps determine where and when there is statistically significant clustering of high and low SNAP participation rates</li>
												<li>Each location was evaluated based on its hot spot and cold spot results each year and then categorized (intensifying hot spot, persistent cold spot, and so on) to help interpret the results</li>
												<li>Visualized the emerging hot spot analysis in 3D to see why each location was assigned a specific category. The 3D scene view shows the yearly values for hot spots. This information provided additional insight into the data. Based on these patterns, I can now investigate areas with consecutive or emerging hot spots to see whether these areas require additional resources that can improve access to healthy foods</li>
												<li>an a local outlier analysis with the result from the emerging hot spot analysis to help determine which areas are statistically significantly different from their neighbors over time. Clusters indicate areas where the only statistically significant type throughout time has been a high or low cluster. Outliers indicate areas where the only statistically significant type throughout time has been a High-Low outlier or a Low-High outlier. Multiple types indicate areas where there have been multiple types of statistically significant clusters or outliers throughout time</li>
												<li>Visualized the cube in 3D to examine the outliers, determining what years and areas were statistically different from their neighbors</li>
												
												<li> <div class="image main"><img src="images/VoterTurnoutGraphs2.pdf" alt="" /></div> </li>
												<li>The relationship between voter turnout and other variables are explored in this scatterplot matrix. The mini-plots in the matrix are visualized with a color gradient that corresponds to the strength of the R-squared value. The larger preview plot highlights the relationship between 2020 Voter Turnout and 2016 Voter Turnout. The 2016 Voter Turnout has a positive relationship with 2020's voter turnout, where a higher 2016 Voter Turnout value corresponds to a higher 2020 voter turnout. The R-squared value for this trend is 0.83, which means that the 2016 Voter Turnout alone can explain about 83 percent of the variability in the voter turnout values.<br />
													While every pairwise combination of variables is plotted in the matrix, you are specifically interested in how each variable relates to voter turnout. The column of mini-plots on the far left includes the relationships between voter turnout and the other variables. /li>
